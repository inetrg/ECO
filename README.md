# Source Files for the ECO Sensor Box
The ECO sensor box is a versatile modular wireless sensor box for perpetual operation based on energy harvesting.
Using a self-adaptive power management the sensor self-adapts its power consumption according to energy availability,
based on real-time, online self measurement of its power consumption and availability.

This repository contains source and design files required to build your own ECO-enabled sensor box.
