# RIOT Energy-Harvesting Monitor using INA226

This module can be used to measure voltage and current of a connected load.
It comes with three different measurement ranges that can be freely configured by mounting different shunt resistors.
Depending on your use case you can switch between the measurement ranges with the slider switches.
The configuration of the board hosts jumpers to configure four different I2C slave addresses.

## BOM

Below is the bill of materials for equipping the pcb. Obviously you can choose to use other parts as long as they have the same footprint and properties. For the lazy ones: you may want to look at [this pre-filled shopping cart at Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=cd3d5edc18) which contains all the parts needed to equip a single PCB.

## Configuration

With the jumpers on JP1 and JP2 you can configure the I2C slave address according to the following table.

| JPA1    | JPA0    | A1 Pin  | A0 Pin  | Address  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
|  1 2-3  |  1 2-3  |  GND    |  GND    |  0x40    |
|  1 2-3  |  1-2 3  |  GND    |  VS     |  0x41    |
|  1-2 3  |  1 2-3  |  VS     |  GND    |  0x44    |
|  1-2 3  |  1-2 3  |  VS     |  VS     |  0x45    |
